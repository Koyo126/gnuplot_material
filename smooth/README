# smooth オプションについて

gnuplot includes a few general-purpose routines for 
interpolation and approximation of data; 
these are grouped under the smooth option. More 
sophisticated data processing may be performed by 
preprocessing the data externally or by using fit 
with an appropriate model.

Syntax:

     smooth {unique | frequency | csplines | acsplines | bezier | sbezier}
